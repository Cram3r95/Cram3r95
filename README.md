### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŽ© My name is Carlos GÃ³mez HuÃ©lamo, Senior Engineer at Arnold NextG GmbH (RÃ¼sselsheim, Germany) since 2023. My main roles in the company include software development for the Drive-By-Wire Project, including Model-in-the-Loop, lab bench validation, ISO26262 and ASIL-D certification. On the other hand, aligned with my previous background and main interest, I am responsible for supervising the Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, Digital Twin and Simulation tasks of the company, particularly for vehicle dynamics estimation (force-feedback, road friction coefficient, road conditions, etc.) with Deep Learning. 

ðŸ’» My main objective is to be a leader in the Automotive Industry regarding embedded and embodied (so, models interacting with the environment) Artificial Intelligence solutions. Main areas of interest consist of Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Robotic frameworks, Embedded Systems and any field related to these, mainly focused on Intelligent Vehicles applications.

ðŸ“š Formerly, I carried out my PhD (2019 - 2023) in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence in the RobeSafe research group (Universidad de AlcalÃ¡, Spain) under the supervision of Prof. Luis Miguel Bergasa and Prof. Rafael Barea Navarro. The PhD thesis was focused on "Predictive Techniques for Scene Understanding by using Deep Learning in Autonomous Driving" ðŸš—ðŸ¤–, receiving, among other acknoledgments, the prestigious IEEE ITS Best Dissertation Award (2024).
