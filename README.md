### Hi there 👋

🎩 My name is Carlos Gómez-Huélamo, a Machine Learning researcher at Identy.io (starting March 2025) in Madrid, Spain 🇪🇸 . My current role focuses on developing anti-spoofing solutions for biometric authentication (NIST, FIDO and ISO, particularly 27001, compliant), enhancing face verification security through sensor fusion of motion and visual data. My responsibilities include designing deep learning models, integrating accelerometer and gyroscope data for liveness detection, and optimizing algorithms for mobile deployment.

💻 My passion lies in applying Artificial Intelligence to real-world challenges. Previously, I worked as a Senior Engineer at Arnold NextG GmbH (Rüsselsheim, Germany 🇩🇪 ), contributing to Drive-By-Wire projects (ISO26262 and ASIL-D certified) and leading AI-driven vehicle dynamics estimation (force-feedback).

📚 I hold a PhD (2019 - 2023) in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence in the RobeSafe research group (Universidad de Alcalá, Spain, with internships in the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany, and in the University of California, Berkeley, United States of America 🇺🇸 ) under the supervision of Prof. Luis Miguel Bergasa and Prof. Rafael Barea Navarro. The PhD thesis was focused on "Predictive Techniques for Scene Understanding by using Deep Learning in Autonomous Driving" 🚗🤖, receiving, among other acknowledgements, the prestigious IEEE ITS Best Dissertation Award (2024). 

🏫 Throughout my career, I have actively contributed to AI research, collaborated with universities and industry partners, and supervised students in perception, mapping, and decision-making for autonomous vehicles. Regarding my academic background, I received my BSc degree in Industrial Electronics and Automation Engineering (Top 3 students ; 2 Academic Awards ; Erasmus+ in the University College of Cork, Ireland 🇮🇪 ) and my MSc in Industrial Engineering (Top 2 students ; 2 Academic Awards ; Erasmus+ in the Tampere University of Technology, Finland 🇫🇮 ) from the Universidad de Alcalá (2017-2019).
